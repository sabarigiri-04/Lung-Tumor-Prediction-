# Lung-Tumor-Prediction
Lung Tumor Prediction 🫁

📌 Project Overview

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection of lung tumors significantly improves treatment outcomes.
This project aims to develop a machine learning / deep learning-based system that predicts the presence of lung tumors from medical images (e.g., CT scans or X-rays).

The system allows users to upload an image and receive a prediction result indicating whether a lung tumor is likely present.

⚙️ Features

🖼️ Upload CT scan / X-ray images

🔍 Automated tumor detection using trained ML/DL models

📊 Accuracy evaluation with metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

🌐 Web application interface (Django/Flask/Streamlit integration)

📂 Dataset preprocessing and augmentation support

🏗️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 3.x

Libraries & Frameworks:

TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (Deep Learning)

OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas (Data Processing)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)

scikit-learn (Evaluation Metrics)

Web Framework (optional): Django / Flask / Streamlit

Database (optional): MySQL / SQLite
